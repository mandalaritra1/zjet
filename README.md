# QJetMassUproot

Uproot-based QJet Mass analysis


## Instructions

To run, there are currently several files that work on NanoAODv9: 

* [Library that defines class to make plots of a dataset](https://github.com/rappoccio/QJetMassUproot/blob/master/response_maker_nanov9_lib.py)
* [Driver script to run over datasets](https://github.com/rappoccio/QJetMassUproot/blob/master/response_maker_nanov9.py)
* [Optional notebook to call running script and draw plots](https://github.com/rappoccio/QJetMassUproot/blob/master/response_maker_nanov9.ipynb)


You can either execute the notebook, or run the driver script on the command line.
